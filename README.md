# Hello OBP OAuth1.0a Django Python3 

This is an example Django project working with Open Bank Project API API Calls. It is a fork of the OBP API Manager (hence you may see various references to apimanager).

To use this app, you need to authenticate against a sandbox where you have to have registered an account beforehand. Currently, you can enable or disable consumers.


## Installation (development)

It is assumed that the git checkout resides inside a project directory, e.g. inside `/var/www/apimanager` and thus to be found at `/var/www/apimanager/API-Manager`.
Paths below are relative to this README. Files produced during installation or at runtime should be outside the git checkout, but inside the project directory, except for Django's local settings. 
The directory tree might look like:

```bash
$ tree -L 2 apimanager/
apimanager/
├── API-Manager
│   ├── apimanager
│   ├── gunicorn.conf.py
│   ├── LICENSE
│   ├── nginx.apimanager.conf
│   ├── NOTICE
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   └── supervisor.apimanager.conf
├── db.sqlite3
├── logs [error opening dir]
├── static-collected
│   ├── admin
│   ├── consumers
│   ├── css
│   ├── img
│   ├── js
│   └── users
└── venv
    ├── bin
    └── lib

13 directories, 8 files
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
$ virtualenv --python=python3 ../venv
$ source ../venv/bin/activate
(venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure settings

Edit `apimanager/apimanager/local_settings.py`:

```python
# Used internally by Django, can be anything of your choice
SECRET_KEY = '<random string>'
# API hostname, e.g. https://api.openbankproject.com
OAUTH_API = '<hostname>'
# Consumer key + secret to authenticate the _app_ against the API
OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY = '<key>'
OAUTH_CONSUMER_SECRET = '<secret>'
# Database filename, default is `../db.sqlite3` relative to this file
DATABASES['default']['NAME'] = '<filename to use for database>'
```

The application's authentication is API-driven. However, to make use of Django's authentication framework and sessions, there is a minimal requirement of a database. Per default, sqlite is used, but you can configure any Django-supported backend you want. Please lookup the appropriate documentation.


### Initialise database

```bash
(venv)$ ./apimanager/manage.py migrate
```

### Run the app

```bash
(venv)$ ./apimanager/manage.py runserver
```

The application should be available at `http://localhost:8000`


## Installation (production)

Execute the same steps as for development, but do not run the app.

### Settings

Edit `apimanager/apimanager/local_settings.py` for additional changes:

```python
# Disable debug
DEBUG = False
# Hosts allowed to access the app
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1', 'localhost', '<your public hostname here>']
# Directory to place static files in, defaults to `../static-collected` relative to this file
STATIC_ROOT = '<dirname>'
# Admins to send e.g. error emails to
ADMINS = [
        ('Admin', 'admin@example.com')
]
# Emails are sent from this address
SERVER_EMAIL = 'apimanager@example.com'
# Emails are sent to this host
EMAIL_HOST = 'mail.example.com'
# Enable email security
EMAIL_TLS = True
```

### Static files

The app's static files, e.g. Javascript, CSS and images need to be collected and made available to a webserver. Run

```bash
(venv)$ ./apimanager/manage.py collectstatic
```

The output will show where they are collected to (`settings.STATIC_ROOT`).

### Web application server

Instead of Django's built-in runserver, you need a proper web application server to run the app, e.g. `gunicorn`. It should have been installed already as a dependency and you use the provided `gunicorn.conf.py`. Run it like

```bash
(venv)$ cd apimanager/ && gunicorn --config ../gunicorn.conf.py apimanager.wsgi 
```

- `gunicorn` does not start successfully when omitting the directory change and using `apimanager.apimanager.wsgi` as program.
- The user running  `gunicorn` needs to have write access to the _directory_ containing the database, as well as the database file itself.
- The app's output is logged to `gunicorn`'s error logfile (see `gunicorn.conf.py` for location)


### Process control

If you do not want to start the web application server manually, but automatically at boot and also want to restart automatically if it dies, a process control system like `supervisor` comes in handy. Stick the provided file `supervisor.apimanager.conf` into `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/`, edit it and reload supervisor (probably as root):

```bash
# /bin/systemctl restart supervisor
```

### Webserver

Finally, use a webserver like `nginx` or `apache` as a frontend. It serves static files from the directory where `collectstatic` puts them and acts as a reverse proxy for gunicorn. Stick the provided `nginx.apimanager.conf` into `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`, edit it and reload the webserver (probably as root):

```bash
# /bin/systemctl reload nginx
```


## Management

The app should tell you if your logged in user does not have the proper role to execute the management functionality you need. Please use a Super Admin user to login and set roles at `/users` to rectify that. To become Super Admin, set the property `super_admin_user_ids` in the API properties file accordingly.


## Final words

Be aware of file permission issues!

Have fun,
 TESOBE
